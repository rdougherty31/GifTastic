# GifTastic

In this GifTastic music app, when the user click the buttons, the UI displays 10 G-rated or PG-rated gifs (generated from the Giphy API) of the musician on the button. When the user clicks on the gifs themselves, the gifs toggle between states - on the first click, the gifs will start playing, on the second click, the gif will stop playing, 3rd they will play, 4th they will stop, and so on. The user also has the option to add their own button by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add New" button, which will function just as the original buttons.
